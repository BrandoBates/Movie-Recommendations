# Movie Recommendations

Uses pandas to read data sets containing movie info and user ratings.

Uses two methods of recommending movies:
1. Lists the most popular movies based on average ratings among all users (this will recommend the same movies for each user)
2. Uses item-item collaborative filtering to estimate ratings based on similar movies.
